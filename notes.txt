combined - PWD - all water - all comes together

poop sewer - same place as storm - combined
potable water - 
storm water

combined sewer overflow - storms - bypasses water treatment plant - delaware river - problem

EPA - cracking down urban places with combined sewer system overflows - CSOs

to minimize - green storm water infrastructure installed - 

can't tell people not to shit - no poop control

storm water can be controller - divert to GSIs (green storm water infrastucture)

GISs infiltration systems back into the ground - media - filters - water table - cycle, standalone or in combintation, tree pits (parallel?) transpire ^^^ city sucks for infiltration (clay, asphalt).. 

bypass pervious surface, put in trench that can infiltrate

can still store, attenuate discharge

1) standalone

2) multi-system

3) slow-release (river) - shit happens

rains, storage, infiltrate (ground, trees, combined when dry) when the flow is low.. always gets to treatment plant and system isn't over burdened
