Combined - PWD - all water systems come together

poop sewer - same place as storm - combined
potable water - 
storm water -

combined sewer overflow - storms - bypasses water treatment plant -> delaware river == problem

EPA is cracking down urban places with combined sewer system overflows (CSOs)

To minimize -> green storm water infrastructure installed

Can't tell people not to shit - no poop control

Storm water can be controlled -> divert to GSIs (green storm water infrastructure)

GISs infiltration systems:
  into the ground
  media (filters)
  water table

standalone or in combintation, tree pits (parallel?) transpire ^^^
city sucks for infiltration (clay, asphalt)..

bypass pervious surface, put in trench that can infiltrate/store & attenuate discharge

1) standalone
2) multi-system
3) slow-release (river) - shit happens

rains, storage, infiltrate (ground, trees, combined when dry) when the flow is low..
always gets to treatment plant and system isn't over burdened
